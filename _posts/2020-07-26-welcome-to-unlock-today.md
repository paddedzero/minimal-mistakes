I've decided to move my page to **Github Pages**. Have decided to start afresh and not migrate my **Wordpress** content. If this is your first time working with things like <span style="color:grey">**git, github, jekyll, markdown or static file generators**</span> - starting afresh might be a good option.

If all these terms seems new to you, not too late to pick them up no matter what your background is. Lots of tutorial videos on using git and there isn't as much programming to muck around on contrary belief if you are looking to just start with something basic. Plus this is a **FREE** option for hosting your webpages and it's definitely worth it to pick this up.

So welcome to 
## **<span style="color:lightblue">"Unlocked.Today"</span>**

### **CONTENTS**

Register your account at
  www.github.com

Github is used as a hosting platform for software development and version control. Commonly used for open-source projects and is **FREE**.

**`step 2 - setup github pages`**

or
**`step 2a - fork a theme from a jekyll theme template`**
used minimalmistakes from mine but there are other such as

- theme 1
- theme 2

for the jekyll layout, default layout should look like the below

**`step 3 - customization of site details`**

now you have setup your first jekyll site with github pages

**DONE with setup!**

Next is to customize your blogging experience by setting up your writting environment

Recommend getting Visual Studio Code which is free and install extensions such as
ext 1
ext 2

once you setup your visual studio code, here are a few things to learn at a glance

1. setting up git pages access
2. serve local jekyll website for previews
3. commit and push your files to github
4. snippets, what are they

thats it
