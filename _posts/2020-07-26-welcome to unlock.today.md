step 3
customize the config.yaml to match your preferred details

step 4
write your firsts posts

Next is to customize your blogging experience by setting up your writting environment

Recommend getting Visual Studio Code which is free and install extensions such as
ext 1
ext 2

once you setup your visual studio code, here are a few things to learn at a glance

1. setting up git pages access
2. serve local jekyll website for previews
3. commit and push your files to github
4. snippets, what are they

thats it
